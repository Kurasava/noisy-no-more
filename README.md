# Noisy No More

**Noisy No More** is a Minecraft mod that adds extra sliders to adjust the volume of sounds from various sources, such as blocks and entities, which can be very loud. For example, pistons, dispensers, villagers, or endermen. The mod also introduces an alternative volume model that decreases the sound level as the number of identical sound sources increases.

### Features:
- **Volume sliders** for loud sound sources like pistons, dispensers, villagers, enderman, and other entities.
- **Alternative volume model** that reduces the volume as more identical sound sources are present. The mod has 3 states:
    - **OFF** â€” the default Minecraft volume model.
    - **only mobs** â€” the model works only for hostile and neutral mobs.
    - **ALL** â€” the model works for all sound sources, including blocks.
- **Client-side only**, which means you can play with the mod anywhere without the need for server support.
- **Backport for older versions**: We plan to release versions of the mod for older Minecraft versions, but this will be done later. Stay tuned for updates!

### Dependencies:
- **Fabric API** â€” required for the mod to work.
