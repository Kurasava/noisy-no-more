# Noisy No More

**Noisy No More** is a Minecraft mod that adds extra sliders to adjust the volume of sounds from various sources, such as blocks and entities, which can be very loud â€” for example, pistons, dispensers, villagers, or enderman. The mod also introduces an alternative volume model that decreases the sound level as the number of identical sound sources increases.

### Features:
- **Volume sliders** for loud sound sources like pistons, dispensers, villagers, enderman, and other entities.
- **Alternative volume model** that reduces the volume as more identical sound sources are present. The mod has three states:
    - **OFF** â€” the default Minecraft volume model.
    - **Only mobs** â€” the model works only for hostile and neutral mobs.
- **Client-side only**, which means you can play with the mod anywhere without needing server support.
- **Backport for older versions**: I plan to release versions of the mod for older Minecraft versions later. Stay tuned for updates!

### How to access the settings:
To open the **Noisy No More** configuration menu, go to **Options â†’ Music & Sounds â†’ Additional Sound Options**.

### Dependencies:
- **Fabric API** â€” required for the mod to work.
